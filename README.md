# Assignment1
My design process kept in mind that it was a personal portfolio site, which would talk about my achievements and skills. This site mainly highlights my achievements throughout my secondary school life, and also skills that I possess, of which are communication and empathy.
Knowing that this is a personal portfolio site where employers would be looking at if looking for potential employees, I have left a form for them to fill for them to contact me which would react with a "submitted" message, thanking them for contacting me. Though it is not fully functional, it provides the aesthetic to the page. 
I largely kept my design similar to my wireframe which I made for this website.
I included pictures of my participation in BYMUN 2019 and also my Good Progress Award certificate to show my improvement in secondary school.
Main features of my page would be the form and the images.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project.
My project looks readable even when on a different view from desktop/laptop.
The images included in my project are personal images.
I received inspiration for this project from my personal website which I made in Semester 1.
